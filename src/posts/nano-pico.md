The experience of writing by a pen on a paper is always better than typing or touching on a screen. Increasing use of technology in daily life is enforcing us to divorce pen from paper. “Nano­-Pico” tries to bridge the gap between physical and digital medium without affecting the natural experience of writing, presenting your thoughts to the whole world. “Nano” is a digital device which also holds the papers. Once paper is attached with the nano, it starts to capture handwritten text with the help of “Pico - a small magnetic ring” attachable to any pen. Nano­Pico works together seamlessly for writing with natural interfaces like pen and paper. Nano­Pico is designed in various forms to blend into different context. This project demonstrates two applications of nano­pico - note taking and task automation. Pino - a smartphone application extends the capabilities of nano­pico, further providing various configuration choices to user. Simple and intuitive gestures defined by this application gives a new language for note­taking and task automation. Nano­-Pico not only promotes the writing but also encapsulates it with zeros and ones.
